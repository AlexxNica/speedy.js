# Enable WASM in Edge

I don't know for certain but I assume that you need a preview version of edge that you get if the fast-ring updates are enabled.

If the computer is configured to use the insider builds then web assembly support can be enabled by navigating to `about:config` and checking the `Enable experimental JavaScript features` Checkbox 

Restart Edge and enjoy!
